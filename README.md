# Python Mastery Journey

Welcome to my **Python Mastery Journey** repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning progress as I advance through the Python Developer path at [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/).

## About This Repository

_"I have served. I will be of service."_

This repository is where I serve my learning journey to the world. It contains all the notes, exercises, and projects I create while following the Python Developer path at Zero to Mastery. It will serve as a portfolio of my progress and a reference for future learning.

## Why Python?

_"It's not just a puppy."_

Python isn't just another programming language for me. I chose Python because of my familiarity with it through my experience with SQL, where I’ve worked extensively with functions. Python’s simplicity resonates with me, and I’m excited to leverage that as I explore deeper concepts. Additionally, knowing that many AI companies are using Python makes it even more compelling to master this language.

## Courses In Progress

_"You have my word, then you have nothing to worry about."_

I’m committed to completing the following courses as part of my Python journey:
